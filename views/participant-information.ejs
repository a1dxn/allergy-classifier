        <h3>Study Title</h3>
        <p><strong> Exploring Machine Learning as a Complementary Aid to Identifying and Diagnosing Allergies </strong></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Invitation</h3>
        <p>You are being asked to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact me if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What is the purpose of this study?</h3>
        <p>This study aims to provide a complimentary aid to identifying an individual&rsquo;s potential food allergies given an existing set of allergies using machine learning models and providing a level of &lsquo;explainability&rsquo; behind the choices of the models.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why have I been invited to participate?</h3>
        <p>You are over the age of 18 years old. You may or may not have an existing food allergy.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
        <p>You are over the age of 18 years old. You may or may not have an existing food allergy.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
        <p>You should use the prediction tool on this website to generate likelihoods that you are allergic to a set of 9 food allergies (as listed within the tool). Then, you should complete the anonymous feedback questionnaire. The prediction tool takes less than 1 minute to complete and is comprised of 1 question concerning what existing food allergies you have. Your input is processed by the server but is not saved once the predictions have been generated. The follow-up anonymous feedback questionnaire takes 1 minute to complete and is comprised of 8 questions concerning the site usability, credibility, loyalty and appearance.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Are there any lifestyle restrictions?</h3>
        <p>There are no restrictions.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3>
        <p>There are no anticipated disadvantages or risks associated with taking part in this study.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
        <p>By completing the anonymous feedback questionnaire, you are helping to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, although there is no benefit to you specifically.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What if something goes wrong?</h3>
        <p>If an error occurs whilst using the prediction tool, the event will be automatically logged by the server and may include the parameters which could have caused the error. This log data is not traceable back to you and is temporary. If an error occurs whilst completing the feedback questionnaire, the form will not submit your response. If you wish to complain about your experience engaging with this study, please see the corresponding section below.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?</h3>
        <p>Yes. None of your allergy information or predictions entered or generated in this tool are saved, however interactions with the tool may be logged temporarily but this cannot be traced back to you. Your feedback response data is anonymous and is only saved once you have submitted the form. This data is encrypted both in transit and when stored on Google servers (response data is saved to a Google Sheets spreadsheet). This data will be kept until July 2021. Your data cannot be withdrawn after submitted as it is anonymous and cannot be traced back to you.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Will I be recorded, and how will the recording be used?</h3>
        <p>No, you will not. Some anonymous data can be collected from you as stated in the above sections.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What will happen to the results of the research study?</h3>
        <p>The anonymous feedback data will be used to generate a usability/satisfaction rating and may be further analysed as part of the evaluation write-up of this study. This will not be publicly available.</p>
