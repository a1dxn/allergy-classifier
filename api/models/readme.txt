I've decided not to use a database for this solution as I think it may be a bit overkill considering it'll just be
read-only actions on static data...so might as well use local files instead!
Initially I'll be implementing this as multiple CSV files pre-organised into train/test sets for each allergy, although
I may switch to a local database instead depending on the performance...who knows!
